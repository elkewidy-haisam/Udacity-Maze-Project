The objective in this app is to complete the maze from start to finish by clicking on waypoints using the Google VR Recticle. The key
and coin at the beginning of the maze are there to show you how to complete the maze. 

When you collect the key, it unlocks the door in front of you, allowing you to start walking through the maze.

The coins are collectibles, there are six of them included in the maze. In addition to this one. Try to find them as an extra challenge!

You win the game by getting to the end of the maze and entering the temple to reach the Treasure Chest. But the temple's door is locked;
you have to find a second key inside the maze in order to unlock it and win the game.

Once you get inside the temple, you will have the option to replay the game by clicking on the "YOU WIN" sign post located inside of it.

Enjoy the game, and best of luck clearing the maze!
